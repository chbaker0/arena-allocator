# Arena Allocator

A fairly simple arena memory allocator for C++. Provides high performance allocation of objects that can be freed all at once. In fact, you have no choice but to free them all at once if you allocate with this.

Useful for numerous purposes including per-frame allocation of objects in rendering engines.
